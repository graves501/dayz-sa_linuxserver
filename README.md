# dayz-sa_linuxserver

This script is a fork of the [Linux Game Server Manager](https://linuxgsm.com) and modified to run a DayZ Standalone 1.15 Experimental Community Server!
It makes use of `tmux` to seperate it from the user shell. It runs completely in the console so you can run it on a Root or V-Server with SSH access. 

**Currently working with DayZ Standalone v1.15 Experimental!**
